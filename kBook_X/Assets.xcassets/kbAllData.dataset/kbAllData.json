      "Lyrics": "Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt,\nYour rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt,\nYou say \"what did you do with him today?\",\nAnd sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray,\n'Cause you're my fella, my guy,\nHand me your stella and fly,\nBy the time I'm out the door,\nYou tear men down like Roger Moore,\n\nI cheated myself,\nLike I knew I would,\nI told you I was trouble,\nYou know that I'm no good,\n\nUpstairs in bed, with my ex boy,\nHe's in a place, but I can't get joy,\nThinking on you in the final throes,\nThis is when my buzzer goes,\nRun out to meet you, chips and pitta,\nYou say 'when we married\",\n'cause you're not bitter,\n\"There'll be none of him no more,\"\nI cried for you on the kitchen floor,\n\nI cheated myself,\nLike I knew I would,\nI told you I was trouble,\nYou know that I'm no good,\n\nSweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain,\nWe're like how we were again,\nI'm in the tub, you on the seat,\nLick your lips as I soak my feet,\nThen you notice little carpet burn,\nMy stomach drops and my guts churn,\nYou shrug and it's the worst,\nWho truly stuck the knife in first\n\nI cheated myself,\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble,\nYou know that I'm no good,\n\nI cheated myself,\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble,\nYeah, you know that I'm no good.",
